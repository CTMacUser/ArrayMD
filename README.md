ArrayMD=======Two class templates, one using variadic parameters to model a multidimensional array, the other a multidimensional array adaptor on top of a container classBesides the aforementioned container (`array_md`) and adaptor (`multiarray`) class templates, there are two helper sub-libraries.  The `indexing_result` and `indexing_noexcept` type-traits class templates calculate the result type and exception status of a chain of `operator []` calls.  The `slice` function templates carry out a chain of `operator []` calls with the base and index objects/values given as variadic function arguments; they have bounds-checking counterparts called `checked_slice`.The four sub-libraries require C++2011 features, so your compiler and standard library has to support being run in C++11 mode.The format of the library is like a prototype [Boost](http://www.boost.org) library submission. As such, the code is under the [Boost Software License](http://www.boost.org/users/license.html).
